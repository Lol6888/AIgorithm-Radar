To facilitate this action, Campaign Management partners are now required to implement a self-declaration step in the LinkedIn campaign creation flow for campaigns targeting the EU region. Partners must pass back this information with LinkedIn via the\n+politicalIntent\n+field in the /adCampaigns schema.Although LinkedIn prohibits political advertising and will continue to do so, this update is required to ensure regulatory compliance and maintain a trusted platform for our members and customers.\n+Conversions API Payload Builder: Enhanced Validation & Direct API Call Support\n+The Conversions API Payload Builder now supports capabilities to enable seamless and efficient integration process for Conversions API. Developers can build and validate syntactically correct /conversionEvents payloads, auto-generate JSON or cURL formats, and test them directly on LinkedIn Developer Portal via the new âMake an API Callâ feature.\n+This self-serve feature streamlines development effort by enabling OAuth access token generation through either a developerâs own app (if API access is provisioned) or a LinkedIn-owned app. Refer to the technical documentation for implementation details.\n+Developer AI Chatbot: Now on the LinkedIn Developer Website\n+Our AI-powered chatbot support has expanded from the Developer platform to the LinkedIn Developer website, making it easier for developers to discover and learn more about LinkedIn API products and access relevant technical information to get started.\n+Breaking Changes\n+The monthly API versions below will be sunset and removed from the platform on the dates listed.

Legacy endpoints that will be sunset include:\n+/adForms\n+,/adFormResponses\n+,/leadNotificationUrls\n+. To prevent service disruptions and ensure access to the latest features, we recommend completing your migration using the migration guide before July 31, 2025.Consider implementing:\n+- In-product notifications to encourage customer action\n+- A forced re-authentication flow to prompt customers to reconnect with the new API\n+If the migration is not completed by the sunset date, customers will no longer be able to sync leads using the legacy Ads Lead Sync API and Events Lead Generation API, leading to significant disruptions in lead delivery and campaign workflows. Migrating to the new Lead Sync API provides access to new features, improved functionality, and enhanced performance. These include the ability to centralize lead collection from ads, events, and other organic sources via a single, streamlined API.\n+Community Management API Enhancements: Empower Customers to Measure and Grow Influence\n+Partners can provide detailed analytics on executive, employee, and brand engagement with LinkedIn audiences.

We support CRM connections with Dynamics 365, Salesforce and HubSpot.\n+New Postman collection folder with sample requests for revenue attribution added here.\n+Add Business Email to Linkedin Application: Do not miss critical LinkedIn communications.\n+We recommend partners to add their preferred business email address to their LinkedIn application to stay informed about critical LinkedIn Developer platform and product updates, including migration or deprecation notices, new APIs, or changes to current APIs. This ensures that you do not miss important LinkedIn communications and helps prevent service interruptions, broken integrations, or loss of functionality.\n+May 2025 - Version 202505\n+Product & Platform Announcements\n+LinkedIn Events Enhancements:\n+Events Management API: Create LinkedIn Live Test Events\n...\n[diff truncated: 765 lines omitted]\n...\n+for deco Starting May, all deco calls for creative URN are resolving via the/creatives\n+endpoint instead of the/adCreativesV2\n+endpoint. Partners who use the adAnalytics endpoint and other endpoints that use deco calls to fetch creatives need to update their calls. All access and refresh token requests should only be made using the POST method after June 30,2023.\n+Product & Platform Announcements\n+Images API & Videos API: Beginning with the 202304 release, we are removing a role check for company URN owners and member URN owners when retrieving an image and/or video. For partners using a combination of /posts and /images or /videos, if /post API viewability checks are satisfied (e.g. you need to own the post as a member or company admin or be a role in AdAccount) you will be able to access images through /images and videos through /video.\n+-\n+- Introducing IMPRESSION_DEVICE_TYPE pivot: Starting with the 202304 version, we are introducing the\n+IMPRESSION_DEVICE_TYPE\n+pivot for both the statistics finder and the analytics finder. When this pivot is used, the results will be grouped by the device type the ad made an impression on, such asMOBILE_APP\n+andDESKTOP_WEB\n+. - Deprecate API Decoration starting from the June 2023 version: Starting with the 202306 version, we are removing API Decoration from the Ad Analytics API. As an alternative, individual requests can be made to access the corresponding entity associated with a URN. More information can be found in LinkedIn Marketing API URN Resolution. For eligible pivots of the Ad Analytics API, we are adding a note that indicates which type of URN will be returned for each pivot. For example, if the MEMBER_COMPANY pivot is used with an analytics finder, then the response will contain a pivot value in the format\n+urn:li:organization: <organizationId>\n+- Introducing IMPRESSION_DEVICE_TYPE pivot: Starting with the 202304 version, we are introducing the\n+Ad Publisher Restrictions API: Externalizing the type field Starting with the 202304 version, we are introducing a new field\n+type\n+. This field can be used to create allowlist by passing type as ALLOWLIST in create method. This is an optional field having a default value as BLOCKLIST for backward compatibility since in earlier versions we supported only creation of BLOCKLIST from API. For example,âtypeâ: âALLOWLISTâ\n+can be used to create allowlist.New training videos To support our developer community, we've started to produce training videos on topics we think you'll find helpful. Our first two cover:\n+- Best practices when working with our API support team\n+- How to handle deprecation of API decoration (see related post in the Migrations & Breaking Changes section above for link)\n+March 2023\n+Product & Platform Announcements\n+Ad Analytics API: Introducing validWorkEmailLeads metric and PLACEMENT_NAME pivot Starting with the 202303 version, we are introducing the following:\n+- validWorkEmailLeads: This metric represents the count of leads with a valid work email that does not use an established free or personal email domain.\n+- PLACEMENT_NAME: This pivot enables grouping of metrics by placement. The pivot values are:\n+LINKEDIN\n+,OFFSITE\n+andOFFSITE_IN_STREAM\n+. Only LAN(Linkedin Audience Network) enabled video campaigns are eligible to deliver on offsite in-stream inventory. When video campaigns deliver on offsite in-stream inventory, you will see the metrics available for \"OFFSITE_IN_STREAM\" placement.\n+Image API & Videos API: Externalizing the Media Library In October 2022, we rolled out the media library in the Campaign Manager UI. The media library provides one location where advertisers can upload, manage, and select images and videos for single image ads and video ads. We are externalizing the media library for our API partners so that advertisers can use the same media library during ad creation on partner platforms.\n+This will allow API partners to perform the following actions:\n+initializeUpload\n+(existing method): This is an existing method for asset upload; the update in the release would be parallel registration under the Media LibraryfindByAssociatedAccount\n+(new method): Return all media library assets under a specific account and asset typepartialUpdate\n+(new method): Update an existing media library asset- specifically to rename an asset or to archive itWe will enable\n+findByIdsAndAssociatedAccount\n+to return specific media library assets based on ID in a future release.\n+Saved Audience Template API: Save Audience Criteria\n+We are introducing a new API to enable the following:Save audiences, including targeting attributes and/or existing matched audiences, for easy re-use in campaigns. This is especially valuable for users who build audiences via the Audience Insights and wish to apply those audiences to a campaign.\n+Fetch audiences to access audience insights when used in tandem with the Audience Insights saved via the Campaign Manager UI.\n+Ads A/B Testing API: Test Campaign Performance\n+We have launched A/B Testing to help our advertisers optimize their ROI with rigorous testing. A/B Testing measures the performance of two campaigns with equal audiences and budgets to test one variable, such as creative content / ad format, targeting, or placement. The testing tool then selects a winner (if any), or verifies that the performance difference between the variants is insignificant or inconclusive.\n+Breaking Changes\n+- Ad Analytics API: Change in structure of query parameters**\n+Starting with the 202303 version, we will change the format of certain query parameters in both the analytics finder and the statistics finder. In both finders, pivot\n+, pivots\n+, timeGranularity\n+, campaignType\n+, and objectiveType\n+would be records containing the expected values instead of directly accepting values. For example, pivot=CAMPAIGN would become pivots=(value:List(CREATIVE,CAMPAIGN))\n+would become pivots=List((value:CREATIVE),(value:CAMPAIGN))\n+.\n+Creatives API: Change in the structure of IntendedStatuses finder parameter** Starting with the 202303 version,\n+intendedStatuses\n+query parameter in the finder request would be a record which would contain the expected array instead of directly accepting an array value. Instead of providingintendedStatuses=List(ARCHIVED,CANCELED)\n+we would require passingintendedStatuses=(value:List(ARCHIVED,CANCELED))\n+.API Decoration Deprecation: In November 2022, we began deprecating API decoration for some APIs. Starting with the 202303 version, we will no longer support decoration on the following APIs:\n+Reminders\n+Migrate to the new Community Management API before June 30, 2023\n+Weâre accelerating our push to release more functionality that enables your customers to know and grow their professional communities â starting with a new Community Management API. Existing community management partners must migrate to the new API by June 30, 2023. Check out this article to learn more about our plans for community management.All access and refresh token requests should only be made using the POST method after June 30, 2023\n+This is a reminder that access token and refresh token requests should be made using only the POST method to/accessToken\n+endpoint with the request headerContent-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded\n+and all required parameters in the request body. We will start returning 400 errors on the GET /accessToken endpoint after June 30, 2023.\n+February 2023\n+Product & Platform Announcements\n+- Posts API: Specify the sort order for finder results\n+Weâre introducing an optionalsortBy\n+parameter to the posts author finder to enable you to specify the sort order for finder results. You can sort by either last modified time or created time, in descending order. The default sort order is by last modified time in descending order.\n+Breaking Changes\n+- Ad Account Users API: API decoration deprecation\n+In November 2022, we began deprecating API decoration for some APIs. Starting with the 202302 version, we will no longer support decoration on theadAccountUsers\n+API.\n+Reminders\n+Migrate to versioned APIs and new Content APIs by February 28, 2023\n+In June 2022, we introduced API Versioning and new Content APIs to make it easier for you to build with ease and manage API changes with predictability. With the new APIs, we plan to sunset the unversioned APIs and legacy Content APIs on February 28, 2023.\n+Migrate to the latest versioned API (February 2023) and the new Content APIs using this migration guide.\n+You can learn more about API versioning at LinkedIn and the new Content APIs through these videos: Versioning, Content APIs.Migrate to the new Community Management API before the end of June 2023\n+Weâre accelerating our push to release more functionality that enables your customers to know and grow their professional communities â starting with a new Community Management API. Existing community management partners must migrate to the new API by June 30, 2023. Check out this article to learn more about our plans for community management.\n+January 2023\n+Product & Platform Announcements\n+LinkedIn Marketing Developer Products refreshed with 2 API products LinkedIn Marketing Developer Products now has 2 API products the Advertising API to build paid marketing solutions and Community Management API to build organic marketing solutions. Check out the updated Developer Portal to learn more on what you can build, with which API, and how it benefits your customers. If you have a paid marketing integration, no action is required. If you have an organic marketing integration, you will need to migrate to the new Community Management API by June 2023 to keep your integration active.\n+Posts API: Find posts authored by a specified member\n+Starting with the 202301 version, weâre introducing a member author finder to enable you to fetch post contents authored by specified members. Results for all /posts finders (findByDscAccount and findByAuthor) will be sorted by last modified time in descending order (latest -> oldest) by default. This will help you manage post contents more efficiently.Ad Analytics API: Sort reporting metrics\n+The finder methods, Analytics and Statistics, of the adAnalytics endpoint now support two additional optional parameters:sortBy.field\n+andsortBy.order\n+. These parameters allow the results of these endpoints to be sorted in an ascending or descending order by one of the following fields:costInLocalCurrency\n+,impressions\n+,clicks\n+,oneClickLeads\n+,opens\n+,sends\n+,externalWebsiteConversions\n+.\n+Breaking Changes\n+Content APIs: New batch size limit To handle batch requests more effectively, batch calls to the following endpoints: /creatives, /inMailContents, /posts, /videos, /images, /conversationAds, will only support 100 requests in a single batch, starting January 18, 2023. This change will apply to all versions.\n+Reminders\n+Migrate to versioned APIs before the end of February 2023 We now support API versioning for all LinkedIn Marketing APIs â giving you the power to decide when to adopt API changes. We will release a new version every month and intend to support each version for a full year with its own set of documentation that covers all Marketing APIs. Continue to check the Recent Changes page to stay up to date on the latest releases.\n+Make sure when calling an API version to include the request header with key âLinkedIn-Versionâ and set the value to correspond with the version youâre referencing using the YYYYMM format. Get started with this blog post, walk through video, or versioning documentation. Make sure to migrate before February 2023 when we will sunset unversioned APIs.\n+New Content APIs that simplify the content creation experience and save you time We introduced four new Content APIs that enable you to build quicker and to adopt the latest formats easier: Images, Videos, Post, and Creatives. With the new APIs, weâve reduced the steps to upload creative assets and create posts; and the APIs are built to support your workflow. Get started with the new migration guide. Make sure to migrate to the new APIs before February 28, 2023 when we will sunset the Shares and UGC APIs.\n+Archived Marketing API Changes\n+To learn more about the Marketing API changes from November 2022 and earlier, refer to:"

See the Migration page for more details.\n+If you havenât yet migrated and have questions, submit a request on the LinkedIn Developer Support Portal.\n+Overview\n+At LinkedIn, weâre continuously evolving our product offerings. Itâs important that our API partners are supported in this journey with the tools and experiences that enable them to innovate and deliver the best solutions to our mutual customers.\n+We understand the value of stable API integrations and the need for clear guidance on planning and making changes to your integrations. You experiment, build, test, and deploy new products all the time.\n+To support this, weâre introducing API versioning across our LinkedIn Marketing API Program. This will ensure your active integrations continue working while you integrate our latest changes.\n+Latest Version\n+| Version Name | Version Header |\n+|---|---|\n+| August 2025 | 202508 |\n+Whatâs changing?\n+LinkedInâs Marketing APIs first versioned API release was June 2022 under a new base path: https://api.linkedin.com/rest/\n+Our versioned API releases follow a monthly cycle. There are several differences compared to the previous release cycle:\n+Legacy (unversioned) Marketing APIs using the base path https://api.linkedin.com/v2/\n+have been sunset.\n+Some of our legacy APIs (V2) have also been renamed and will be published according to the following table:\n+| Legacy endpoint | Versioned endpoint |\n+|---|---|\n+| /adInMailContentsV2 | /adInMailContents |\n+| /audienceCountsV2 | /audienceCounts |\n+| /adSegmentsV2 | /adSegments |\n+| /adAnalyticsV2 | /adAnalytics |\n+| /sharesV2 | /posts |\n+| /ugcPosts | /posts |\n+| /adAccountsV2 | /adAccounts |\n+| /adAccountUsersV2 | /adAccountUsers |\n+| /adCampaignGroupsV2 | /adCampaignGroups |\n+| /adCampaignsV2 | /adCampaigns |\n+| /adCreativesV2 | /creatives |\n+| /insightTagDomainsV2 | /insightTagDomains |\n+| /adCampaignInsightsV2 | /adCampaignInsights |\n+API clients will use HTTP headers to indicate the API version. Releases are titled according to the month in which the development work commenced - again, similar to the way we have pushed releases in the past. Comprehensive documentation and change guides will accompany each release. Our versioned Marketing APIs will be supported and stable for a minimum of one year before sunset.\n+Technical Documentation\n+LinkedInâs LinkedIn Marketing API Program supports versioning so API partners can release changes over time. This document explains how to use versioned APIs.\n+Why are our APIs versioned?\n+LinkedIn makes continuous improvements to our products, and thus our APIs must change too. But we want our API partners to have trust in stable integrations with reliable change schedules so that they can plan and execute better over time.\n+Thatâs why weâve created a stable supported window of one (1) year (minimum) for our Marketing APIs.\n+How your API client should use versioning\n+HTTP headers will be used for clients to indicate which API version implementation they expect. Include a request header with the key âLinkedIn-Versionâ and set the value to the version (format: YYYYMM) to correspond with the documentation version youâre referencing, for example - âLinkedIn-Version: 202411â would indicate that you are using the version published in the month of November.\n+curl -X POST 'https://api.linkedin.com/rest/adCampaigns' \\\n+-H 'Authorization: Bearer {INSERT_TOKEN}' \\\n+-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n+-H 'Linkedin-Version: 202411â \\\n+--data '{\n+\"account\": \"urn:li:sponsoredAccount:123212321\",\n+\"audienceExpansionEnabled\": false,\n+`}\n+...\n+Version Headers\n+In many cases, the URL resource paths your integration uses may not change across versions, but the behavior of the individual API methods will. For example, there may be new parameters required or new fields available on the response schemas.\n+The API changes must include the Version Header for the version (release) that needs to be adopted.\n+Example\n+For the November 2024 LMS Release, the versioned header would be: \"LinkedIn-Version\": \"202411\"\n+. Version headers are tied to the LMS Release date:\n+| Version | Version Header Values |\n+|---|---|\n+| November 2024 | \"LinkedIn-Version\": \"202411\" |\n+| October 2024 | \"LinkedIn-Version\": \"202410\" |\n+| September 2024 | \"LinkedIn-Version\": \"202409\" |\n+Versioned API Docs\n+Each version of the LinkedIn Marketing API Program has distinct and comprehensive documentation covering all supported APIs. It also includes a changelog indicating all changes from the previous version indicating which resources have been updated or added. Initially, users will have the option on each page in the marketing folder to view: Versioned content: âMarketing {Month} 202Xâ.\n+Version Cadence\n+LinkedIn Marketing API Program will publish new versions monthly, and those versions will be supported for a minimum of one (1) year.\n+Individual API resources may evolve at different times (e.g. a reporting API may be updated one quarter a year). And each API resource will have its own migration guide to help you navigate major updates.\n+You could choose to integrate with the newest API changes as soon as theyâre released or wait until youâre ready - as long as itâs within the one year change API support window.\n+Expectations\n+Keep up with us\n+LinkedIn expects that our LinkedIn Marketing API Program API partners work to deliver the latest and most valuable experiences to our customers within a reasonable time of their availability. As a result, we will sunset our API versions as early as one (1) year after release.\n+No unversioned calls\n+LinkedIn expects every versioned API call to specify a version; we will not default you to the latest version. Itâs important to us that customers have the best possible experience with LinkedIn integrations. And itâs more likely that customers have a great experience when the integration is being regularly maintained (at least once per year).\n+Breaking Change Exceptions\n+At times, LinkedIn may need to change APIs within the supported stable window.\n+LinkedIn reserves the right to release a patch version to any API if required for any critical security or privacy issues or bug fixes. While the likelihood of these scenarios is minimal, we will work closely with partners to minimize the impact of any breaking changes.\n+FAQ\n+Which versions can I use?\n+You can use any version that hasnât been sunset. The documentation will reflect all available API versions. Migrating to the latest version, however, comes with two important benefits:\n+- You can take advantage of all of our latest features.\n+- You have the option to wait up to a full year before having to migrate again.\n+How do I migrate from an older API version to a later version?\n+To migrate your app from an older version to a later version, simply update the older versionâs YYYYMM\n+formatted value in the header to the later versionâs value. For example, hereâs how youâd migrate from the November 2023 version to the November 2024 version.\n+-H âLinkedin-Version: 202311â to -H âLinkedin-Version: 202411â\n+Reasons for migrating to a later version include:\n+- Avoiding service disruptions; it's important to upgrade to a newer supported version before the older version is no longer supported (weâve committed to supporting each version for a minimum of one year).\n+- Utilizing new features that are not accessible in the older version.\n+Which version of the API should I migrate to?\n+While you can migrate to any later version of the API, migrating to the latest version comes with two important benefits:\n+- You can take advantage of all of our latest features.\n+- You have the option to wait up to a full year before having to migrate again.\n+What happens if the Version Header is missing in the request?\n+An error response is returned when the version header is missing in the request. Refer to Sample Response here\n+What happens if a deprecated Version Header is used in the request?\n+An error response is returned when the version header is deprecated (e.g., 202401). Refer to sample response here"

The changes include the deprecation of several legacy endpoints and the introduction of new fields and metrics to enhance functionality and data clarity. According to the announcement, developers will have until January 21, 2026, to migrate Marketing API endpoints and until April 21, 2025, to update Graph API endpoints.\n+The updates focus on replacing older objects such as Instagram User\n+, Instagram Media\n+, Instagram Carousel\n+, and Instagram Comment\n+with their newer counterparts: IG User\n+, IG Media\n+, and IG Comment\n+. These changes are designed to provide parity for most use cases while removing redundant or outdated fields. For example, the Instagram Media\n+object will no longer support fields like filter_name\n+, location\n+, latitude\n+, and longitude\n+. Similarly, the permalink\n+and caption\n+fields for carousel child media will be removed.\n+The IG User\n+object introduces new fields such as has_profile_picture\n+, is_published\n+, and edges like /authorized_adaccounts\n+, /agencies\n+, and /upcoming_events\n+. These additions aim to provide more comprehensive data for developers. The follow_count\n+and followed_by_count\n+fields have been renamed to follows_count\n+and followers_count\n+, respectively, while profile_pic\n+is now profile_picture_url\n+.\n+For media objects, the taken_at\n+field in Instagram Media\n+corresponds to the timestamp\n+field in IG Media\n+. The content_type\n+field, which previously returned an integer, now returns an enum string value (e.g., 0 → IMAGE, 1 → VIDEO, 4 → BROADCAST, 8 → CAROUSEL_ALBUM). The caption_text\n+field in Instagram Media\n+aligns with the caption\n+field in IG Media\n+, though carousel child captions will no longer be available. The display_url\n+and video_url\n+fields have been consolidated into a single media_url\n+field, simplifying data retrieval.\n+The Instagram Comment\n+object has also been updated. The instagram_user\n+field now corresponds to the user\n+field, which returns an IG User\n+instead of an Instagram User\n+. Meta has introduced new ID fields, such as ig_user_id\n+, ig_media_id\n+, and ig_comment_id\n+, to facilitate the transition from legacy objects. These fields will remain available until April 21, 2025.\n+In the Marketing API, fields like instagram_actor_id\n+and instagram_story_id\n+will be replaced with instagram_user_id\n+and instagram_media_id\n+, respectively. Any edge that previously returned an Instagram User\n+will now return an IG User\n+. According to the announcement, several endpoints will no longer support legacy objects starting January 21, 2026. These include /generatepreviews\n+, /act_<adaccount_id>/generatepreviews\n+, and various endpoints for ad campaigns, creatives, and async ad requests.\n+For the Graph API, legacy objects will no longer be supported after April 21, 2025. Affected endpoints include those for retrieving Instagram user data, media, comments, and carousels, as well as endpoints for managing Instagram accounts linked to Facebook Pages and business assets.\n+Meta has also introduced changes to the Insights API to improve metric clarity. In August 2024, Instagram introduced views\n+as the primary consumption metric for measuring content performance across reels, live videos, photos, carousels, and stories. Starting with API v22, the views\n+metric will be available for both media and user insights. For media insights, Feed, Story, and Reels objects will return views. User insights will support the views\n+metric with multi-dimensional breakdowns for follower type and media product type.\n+Several older metrics will be deprecated in v22. These include plays\n+, clips_replays_count\n+, and ig_reels_aggregated_all_plays_count\n+for media insights, as well as impressions\n+for both media and user insights. The impressions\n+metric will only be deprecated for media created on or after July 2, 2024. For older media, the API will continue to return impressions\n+values as usual.\n+According to the announcement, these updates aim to align the functionality of the Instagram API with the Instagram app, providing businesses and creators with more accurate and actionable data. Developers are encouraged to review the changes and update their applications by the specified deadlines to avoid disruptions.\n+The January 21, 2025 announcement reflects Meta’s ongoing efforts to streamline its developer tools and improve data transparency. By consolidating endpoints, introducing new fields, and refining metrics, the company aims to make it easier for developers to build solutions that meet the needs of businesses and creators.\n+These updates come at a time when digital platforms are increasingly focused on providing clear and reliable data to users. The shift toward views\n+as a primary metric underscores the importance of understanding content performance in a way that aligns with user behavior.\n+Meta’s approach to simplifying API integrations and enhancing data clarity demonstrates a commitment to supporting developers and businesses in a rapidly changing digital landscape. The changes announced on January 21, 2025, are expected to have a significant impact on how developers interact with Instagram and Marketing APIs, paving the way for more efficient and effective solutions.\n+As the deadlines for migration approach, developers and businesses will need to carefully review the updates and plan their transitions accordingly. The availability of new fields and metrics, along with the deprecation of legacy objects, represents a significant step forward in the evolution of Meta’s developer tools."

We want to make the most of people’s time, and we believe that using technology to personalize everyone’s experience is the best way to do that.\"\n+In other words, Instagram's algorithms have one goal: to make you stay on the app longer by delivering content you'll find relevant and interesting.\n+The algorithm majorly affects how social media managers work.\n+“Instagram’s algorithms impact the day-to-day life of just about social media professional in big ways,” says Later’s Social Team.\n+“In order to create best-in-class content that drives growth and engagement, we’re required to produce a wide range of assets—from videos to statics, carousels, stories, to lives, and more—multiple times a day, every day.”\n+However, you can use it to your advantage.\n+By tailoring your strategy to \"hack\" what Instagram's algorithm is prioritizing — so you can reach more users and build a community of engaged followers.\n+How Does the Instagram Algorithm Work in 2025?\n+There are multiple factors that Instagram will use to evaluate its algorithm in 2025, depending on what you’re posting.\n+According to a deep dive into ranking from Instagram itself, each algorithm uses different “signals” to determine what will rank on your feed.\n+The major takeaway? Each Instagram algorithm ranks content based on different signals:\n+The Instagram Feed algorithm: Your activity in-feed (likes, comments, shares, and saves), and info about the post and the person who posted.\n+The Instagram Stories algorithm: Stories you've viewed or engaged with in the past.\n+The Instagram Explore Page algorithm: Your activity in Explore (likes, comments, and shares), and info about the post and the person who posted.\n+The Instagram Reels algorithm: Your activity in Reels (likes, comments, shares, and saves), and info about the Reel and the person who posted.\n+Here’s what all of these signals have in common: The algorithm will reward content that resonates with your audience.\n+Read on for an in-depth breakdown of how each algorithm works.\n+How the Instagram Algorithm Works for Feed Posts\n+Remember the days when your Instagram was a chronological story of what your friends were eating for lunch that day?\n+Now, things are a little more complex.\n+The feed now consists of Reels and posts from followed accounts as well as suggested content.\n+The signals the Instagram algorithm uses to evaluate feed posts are:\n+Your activity: Users see content from topics and accounts that they're already liking, saving, or sending.\n+Information about the post: If a feed post is going viral or has a high engagement rate, Instagram is more likely to include it in the feed.\n+Information about the poster: People get recommended posts from users who are similar to the ones they already follow and interact with.\n+Your history of interacting with someone: If you’re always liking someone’s posts or frequently visiting their profile, the algorithm will consider this.\n+The moral of the story is the higher the engagement your posts have, the better.\n+TIP: Use Later's Instagram Analytics to understand which posts deliver the highest engagement for your account and optimize your strategy.\n+How the Instagram Reels Algorithm Works\n+Knowing how to \"hack\" the Reels algorithm can be a huge advantage for anyone looking to grow on Instagram.\n+Much like feed posts, Instagram prioritizes Reels based on what it believes a viewer will be most likely to interact with.\n+The signals it uses to determine Reels ranking are very similar to feed posts:\n+Your activity\n+Information about the reel\n+Information about the poster\n+Your history of interacting with someone\n+According to Instagram, brands and creators should create Reels that are entertaining, inspiring, or experimental and use creative tools like text, camera effects, or filters.\n+Psst, bookmark this blog for additional Reels tips: The Ultimate Guide to Instagram Reels.\n+How the Instagram Story Algorithm Works\n+The Instagram story algorithm works a little differently, as you don’t see accounts you haven’t followed in your Story feed (yet).\n+However, the key ranking signals for the Instagram Story algorithm are similar:\n+Viewing history: The algorithm will start by showing people the stories they know they’ll enjoy (so they’ll stay on the app longer, of course).\n+Engagement history: People are served stories from accounts that they’ve previously DMed or reacted to.\n+Closeness: The algorithm evaluates how likely it is that an account comes from a close friend or family member. That’s why you’ll often see Close Friends’ stories show up at the beginning of the Story feed.\n+ICYMI: With Later, you can plan and automatically publish your Instagram Stories, add captions or links, and set a publish time.\n+Start scheduling your Instagram Stories in advance with Later with a free trial of any plan.\n+How the Instagram Explore Page Algorithm Works\n+The Instagram Explore page algorithm delivers content that it thinks you’ll be most interested in, based on your prior interactions.\n+While your Instagram Home feed is mostly made up of content from accounts you already follow, the Explore feed consists entirely of content from new accounts.\n+The signals the algorithm uses to rank Explore posts include:\n+Information about the post: How popular a post seems to be — like how quickly users are interacting with it. These signals matter much more here than they do for Feed and Stories.\n+Activity in Explore: How you've interacted with posts in the past.\n+Information about the person who posted: How many times people have interacted with them in the past few weeks.\n+The Explore page is constantly evolving, with new topic categories and advanced search functionalities being introduced all the time.\n+So, by continually sharing engaging content with strong captions, relevant keywords, and niche hashtags, you’re optimizing your posts for Explore page potential.\n+TIP: Write your Instagram captions in advance with Later's Instagram Scheduler.\n+How to Reset the Instagram Algorithm\n+Short answer: You can't \"reset\" the Instagram algorithm.\n+If your account isn’t appearing on any feeds, you may have been “shadowbanned”. Read this post to learn what shadowbanning is - and how to undo it.\n+However, there are a couple of ways you can refresh the content shown in your feed:\n+By clearing your search history\n+By tapping \"Not Interested\" on suggested posts\n+The good news? If you haven't been shadowbanned, there's plenty you can do to boost the chances of others seeing your content (keep reading).\n+7 Tips to Beat the Instagram Algorithm in 2025\n+If you want to improve your ranking with the Instagram algorithm, the best thing you can do is drive as many interactions (likes, comments, saves, and clicks) as possible.\n+And by building momentum with your existing community, you’ll soon find your content surfaced to new audiences.\n+Here are seven ways to improve your algorithmic ranking and reach new audiences:\n+Tip #1: Use Instagram SEO\n+Optimizing your Instagram for search - whether that be through the Explore page or through the search bar - is one of the best ways to keep your account discoverable.\n+And when it’s easy to find your content, you’ll be encouraging those interactions that the algorithm sees as strong signals.\n+From using keywords in your captions and profiles to adding subtitles to Instagram Reels, Instagram SEO is an essential social media tool.\n+Tip #2: Encourage More Interactions with Instagram Stories Stickers\n+Instagram Stories stickers are a great way to encourage audience engagement — and the more engagement your posts get, the higher they’ll be boosted by the Instagram algorithm.\n+There are lots of Instagram stickers, but the best ones for driving engagement are the poll, emoji slider, and question stickers.\n+TIP: Include a sticker on your first story for an added boost!\n+Tip #3: Drive Conversations with Engaging Captions\n+Instagram has confirmed comments and likes are important when it comes to feed ranking — so it’s a good idea to encourage as many as possible for your posts.\n+One of the best ways to do this? Write strong captions that drive engagement.\n+This could be as simple as asking your followers to share their thoughts, double-tap if they agree, tag a friend in the comments, or click the link in your bio.\n+With Later's AI Caption Writer, you can create on-brand captions in seconds — no brainstorming required.\n+Tip #4: Add Relevant Hashtags to Your Posts\n+Adding hashtags to your posts is an effective way to reach more people on Instagram, which means more “views” for the Instagram algorithm to take into account.\n+It’s important to focus on quality, hyper-relevant hashtags — even using 5 or 10 hashtags is better than zero.\n+Use Later's Hashtag Suggestions tool to automatically find relevant hashtags for your posts based on your caption and other hashtags you search. Work smarter, not harder.\n+Tip #5: Optimize for Views\n+Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced in the summer of 2024 that Instagram’s analytics would be views-focused and that users should optimize for Views instead of likes and engagement.\n+This update indicates that you should evaluate your content’s success on how visible it is.\n+While we don’t have this confirmed, this also suggests that Views might be seen by Instagram’s algorithm as a strong ranking signal.\n+Some ways you can optimize for Views include:\n+Creating trends-focused content\n+Collaborating with other creators\n+Engage with your audience\n+Post at your personalized Best Time to Post\n+Tip #6: Cross-promote Your Instagram Content\n+If you’re looking for a quick and easy engagement win to help boost your algorithm ranking, cross-promoting your Instagram content is a great place to start.\n+Instagram Collabs posts (with co-shared authorship) are an incredible new way to reach new audiences.\n+You’ll share views, likes, and comments — allowing you to leverage and engage with each other’s communities.\n+Tip #7: Use Instagram Analytics to See What’s Working\n+Tracking and monitoring analytics is one of the most reliable ways to take on the Instagram algorithm.\n+Having a better understanding of what’s working (and what isn’t) will help you come up with a finely-tuned marketing plan, saving you time and effort in the long run.\n+But diving into your Instagram Analytics means more than just finding out which photo, video, or Reel performed best.\n+Truly understanding how your content performs — by tracking key metrics over time — is vital to knowing what helps improve your ranking.\n+The easiest way to do this? Later’s Analytics feature:\n+The tool lets you track up to 12 months' worth of Instagram feed posts, Stories, and Reels so you can see exactly what's performed best — and filter by key metrics like engagement, followers, reach, likes, and more.\n+Plus, you can export your Instagram analytics directly to your desktop (in a CSV file) making it easy to keep all of your numbers in spreadsheet format.\n+How to Get Ahead of the Instagram Algorithm\n+The best way to gain an advantage with the Instagram algorithm in 2025?\n+Know your niche, create engaging content, and be consistent. The Instagram algorithm will do the rest.\n+TIP: Plan your Instagram content in advance so you can have an organized content calendar (and save time!). Start a free trial with Later today."
