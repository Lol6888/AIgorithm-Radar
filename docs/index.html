+A couple I know has seen my social media work on different platforms and want to hire me, mostly for reels, for the coffee shop they own and are only wanting a couple a week. What would you charge for this? The reels I usually make are NOT super production heavy and are mainly short comedy skits I film on my iphone. I usually average 4k-25k views with a solid amount of organic engagement. I also live in the midwest so marketing/social media is not super lucrative compared to cities so I’m trying to figure out a fair price for them without undervaluing myself.
+The CEO of Instagram just confirmed it: hashtags are no longer the magic growth trick they used to be. They barely move the needle for reach anymore.
+If you want to grow faster on Instagram in 2025, here’s what you should be doing instead:
+-
+Profile Settings → Account Privacy → Turn ON “Allow public photos and videos to appear on Google.” This helps your content show up outside Instagram’s walls
+-
+Profile Settings → Media Quality → Turn ON “Upload at highest quality.” Instagram prioritizes crisp, high-res uploads in recommendations.
+-
+Before posting a Reel → More Options → Turn ON “Recommend on Facebook” and “Recommend on Explore.” These push your content to more viewers without them following you.
+-
+On desktop → Edit Profile → Enable “Suggest your profile to art lovers” (or relevant audience setting for your niche). This makes Instagram actively promote your profile to people who care about your content’s topic.
+TL;DR: Hashtags aren’t dead because of a conspiracy — they’re just not how Instagram finds and recommends posts anymore. Turn on these settings and let the algorithm actually work for you.
+Want more than just reach? At Layba.gg, we help small creators monetize their content across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts. Join our creator community, learn growth strategies like this, and start turning your audience into actual income.
+to anybody who's into poetries Hie I'm @theshrishtieffect on instagram. Please check it out if have a minute. And follow if you like the vibe.

+Campaigns API: Political Advertising Declaration for EU-Targeted Campaigns
+Starting October 10, 2025, advertisers running campaigns targeting the EU region must self-declare if their ads qualify as political advertising under the EUâs Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising (TTPA) regulation. To facilitate this action, Campaign Management partners are now required to implement a self-declaration step in the LinkedIn campaign creation flow for campaigns targeting the EU region. Partners must pass back this information with LinkedIn via the
+politicalIntent
+field in the /adCampaigns schema.Although LinkedIn prohibits political advertising and will continue to do so, this update is required to ensure regulatory compliance and maintain a trusted platform for our members and customers.
+Conversions API Payload Builder: Enhanced Validation & Direct API Call Support
+The Conversions API Payload Builder now supports capabilities to enable seamless and efficient integration process for Conversions API. Developers can build and validate syntactically correct /conversionEvents payloads, auto-generate JSON or cURL formats, and test them directly on LinkedIn Developer Portal via the new âMake an API Callâ feature.
+This self-serve feature streamlines development effort by enabling OAuth access token generation through either a developerâs own app (if API access is provisioned) or a LinkedIn-owned app. Refer to the technical documentation for implementation details.
+Developer AI Chatbot: Now on the LinkedIn Developer Website
+Our AI-powered chatbot support has expanded from the Developer platform to the LinkedIn Developer website, making it easier for developers to discover and learn more about LinkedIn API products and access relevant technical information to get started.

+Sunset of legacy Lead Sync APIs on July 31, 2025
+LinkedInâs legacy Lead Sync APIs will be fully sunset on July 31, 2025. Legacy endpoints that will be sunset include:
+/adForms
+,/adFormResponses
+,/leadNotificationUrls
+. To prevent service disruptions and ensure access to the latest features, we recommend completing your migration using the migration guide before July 31, 2025.Consider implementing:
+- In-product notifications to encourage customer action
+- A forced re-authentication flow to prompt customers to reconnect with the new API
+If the migration is not completed by the sunset date, customers will no longer be able to sync leads using the legacy Ads Lead Sync API and Events Lead Generation API, leading to significant disruptions in lead delivery and campaign workflows. Migrating to the new Lead Sync API provides access to new features, improved functionality, and enhanced performance. These include the ability to centralize lead collection from ads, events, and other organic sources via a single, streamlined API.
+Community Management API Enhancements: Empower Customers to Measure and Grow Influence
+Partners can provide detailed analytics on executive, employee, and brand engagement with LinkedIn audiences. These updates provide increased visibility into individual profile analytics, including metrics for content performance and follower growth, supporting improved influencer and creator strategies on LinkedIn.
+Key capabilities include:
+- Content Analytics: Access granular metrics for member-generated content, including impressions, reach, and engagement (reactions, comments, reposts) across individual posts or aggregated content.
+- Follower Growth Tracking: Track follower trends over custom timeframes to uncover momentum, identify growth spikes, and assess engagement patterns.
+- Video Insights: Measure short-form video performance, a popular content format on LinkedIn with metrics such as watch time, total views, and unique viewers.
+These enhancements support social media management tools, executive visibility platforms, and influencer analytics providers, enabling measurement and analysis of influence and impact on LinkedIn. For more details, refer to the community management use cases.

+Product & Platform Announcements
+Images API & Videos API: Beginning with the 202304 release, we are removing a role check for company URN owners and member URN owners when retrieving an image and/or video. For partners using a combination of /posts and /images or /videos, if /post API viewability checks are satisfied (e.g. you need to own the post as a member or company admin or be a role in AdAccount) you will be able to access images through /images and videos through /video.
+-
+- Introducing IMPRESSION_DEVICE_TYPE pivot: Starting with the 202304 version, we are introducing the
+IMPRESSION_DEVICE_TYPE
+pivot for both the statistics finder and the analytics finder. When this pivot is used, the results will be grouped by the device type the ad made an impression on, such asMOBILE_APP
+andDESKTOP_WEB
+. - Deprecate API Decoration starting from the June 2023 version: Starting with the 202306 version, we are removing API Decoration from the Ad Analytics API. As an alternative, individual requests can be made to access the corresponding entity associated with a URN. More information can be found in LinkedIn Marketing API URN Resolution. For eligible pivots of the Ad Analytics API, we are adding a note that indicates which type of URN will be returned for each pivot. For example, if the MEMBER_COMPANY pivot is used with an analytics finder, then the response will contain a pivot value in the format
+urn:li:organization: <organizationId>
+- Introducing IMPRESSION_DEVICE_TYPE pivot: Starting with the 202304 version, we are introducing the
+Ad Publisher Restrictions API: Externalizing the type field Starting with the 202304 version, we are introducing a new field
+type
+. This field can be used to create allowlist by passing type as ALLOWLIST in create method. This is an optional field having a default value as BLOCKLIST for backward compatibility since in earlier versions we supported only creation of BLOCKLIST from API. For example,âtypeâ: âALLOWLISTâ
+can be used to create allowlist.New training videos To support our developer community, we've started to produce training videos on topics we think you'll find helpful. Our first two cover:
+- Best practices when working with our API support team
+- How to handle deprecation of API decoration (see related post in the Migrations & Breaking Changes section above for link)
+March 2023
+Product & Platform Announcements
+Ad Analytics API: Introducing validWorkEmailLeads metric and PLACEMENT_NAME pivot Starting with the 202303 version, we are introducing the following:
+- validWorkEmailLeads: This metric represents the count of leads with a valid work email that does not use an established free or personal email domain.
+- PLACEMENT_NAME: This pivot enables grouping of metrics by placement. The pivot values are:
+LINKEDIN
+,OFFSITE
+andOFFSITE_IN_STREAM
+. Only LAN(Linkedin Audience Network) enabled video campaigns are eligible to deliver on offsite in-stream inventory. When video campaigns deliver on offsite in-stream inventory, you will see the metrics available for "OFFSITE_IN_STREAM" placement.
+Image API & Videos API: Externalizing the Media Library In October 2022, we rolled out the media library in the Campaign Manager UI. The media library provides one location where advertisers can upload, manage, and select images and videos for single image ads and video ads. We are externalizing the media library for our API partners so that advertisers can use the same media library during ad creation on partner platforms.
+This will allow API partners to perform the following actions:
+initializeUpload
+(existing method): This is an existing method for asset upload; the update in the release would be parallel registration under the Media LibraryfindByAssociatedAccount
+(new method): Return all media library assets under a specific account and asset typepartialUpdate
+(new method): Update an existing media library asset- specifically to rename an asset or to archive itWe will enable
+findByIdsAndAssociatedAccount
+to return specific media library assets based on ID in a future release.
+Saved Audience Template API: Save Audience Criteria
+We are introducing a new API to enable the following:Save audiences, including targeting attributes and/or existing matched audiences, for easy re-use in campaigns. This is especially valuable for users who build audiences via the Audience Insights and wish to apply those audiences to a campaign.
+Fetch audiences to access audience insights when used in tandem with the Audience Insights saved via the Campaign Manager UI.
+Ads A/B Testing API: Test Campaign Performance
+We have launched A/B Testing to help our advertisers optimize their ROI with rigorous testing. A/B Testing measures the performance of two campaigns with equal audiences and budgets to test one variable, such as creative content / ad format, targeting, or placement. The testing tool then selects a winner (if any), or verifies that the performance difference between the variants is insignificant or inconclusive.
+Breaking Changes
+- Ad Analytics API: Change in structure of query parameters**
+Starting with the 202303 version, we will change the format of certain query parameters in both the analytics finder and the statistics finder. In both finders, pivot
+, pivots
+, timeGranularity
+, campaignType
+, and objectiveType
+would be records containing the expected values instead of directly accepting values. For example, pivot=CAMPAIGN would become pivots=(value:List(CREATIVE,CAMPAIGN))
+would become pivots=List((value:CREATIVE),(value:CAMPAIGN))
+.
+Creatives API: Change in the structure of IntendedStatuses finder parameter** Starting with the 202303 version,
+intendedStatuses
+query parameter in the finder request would be a record which would contain the expected array instead of directly accepting an array value. Instead of providingintendedStatuses=List(ARCHIVED,CANCELED)
+we would require passingintendedStatuses=(value:List(ARCHIVED,CANCELED))
+.API Decoration Deprecation: In November 2022, we began deprecating API decoration for some APIs. Starting with the 202303 version, we will no longer support decoration on the following APIs:

+Posts API: Find posts authored by a specified member
+Starting with the 202301 version, weâre introducing a member author finder to enable you to fetch post contents authored by specified members. Results for all /posts finders (findByDscAccount and findByAuthor) will be sorted by last modified time in descending order (latest -> oldest) by default. This will help you manage post contents more efficiently.Ad Analytics API: Sort reporting metrics

This change will apply to all versions.
+Reminders
+Migrate to versioned APIs before the end of February 2023 We now support API versioning for all LinkedIn Marketing APIs â giving you the power to decide when to adopt API changes. We will release a new version every month and intend to support each version for a full year with its own set of documentation that covers all Marketing APIs. Continue to check the Recent Changes page to stay up to date on the latest releases.
+Make sure when calling an API version to include the request header with key âLinkedIn-Versionâ and set the value to correspond with the version youâre referencing using the YYYYMM format. Get started with this blog post, walk through video, or versioning documentation. Make sure to migrate before February 2023 when we will sunset unversioned APIs.
+New Content APIs that simplify the content creation experience and save you time We introduced four new Content APIs that enable you to build quicker and to adopt the latest formats easier: Images, Videos, Post, and Creatives. With the new APIs, weâve reduced the steps to upload creative assets and create posts; and the APIs are built to support your workflow. Get started with the new migration guide. Make sure to migrate to the new APIs before February 28, 2023 when we will sunset the Shares and UGC APIs.

+Warning
+Deprecation Notice
+The Marketing Version 202408 (Marketing August 2024) has been sunset. We recommend that you migrate to the latest versioned APIs to avoid disruptions. See the Migration page for more details.
+If you havenât yet migrated and have questions, submit a request on the LinkedIn Developer Support Portal.
+Overview
+At LinkedIn, weâre continuously evolving our product offerings. Itâs important that our API partners are supported in this journey with the tools and experiences that enable them to innovate and deliver the best solutions to our mutual customers.
+We understand the value of stable API integrations and the need for clear guidance on planning and making changes to your integrations. You experiment, build, test, and deploy new products all the time.
+To support this, weâre introducing API versioning across our LinkedIn Marketing API Program. This will ensure your active integrations continue working while you integrate our latest changes.
+Latest Version
+| Version Name | Version Header |
+|---|---|
+| August 2025 | 202508 |
+Whatâs changing?
+LinkedInâs Marketing APIs first versioned API release was June 2022 under a new base path: https://api.linkedin.com/rest/
+Our versioned API releases follow a monthly cycle. There are several differences compared to the previous release cycle:
+Legacy (unversioned) Marketing APIs using the base path https://api.linkedin.com/v2/
+have been sunset.
+Some of our legacy APIs (V2) have also been renamed and will be published according to the following table:
+| Legacy endpoint | Versioned endpoint |
+|---|---|
+| /adInMailContentsV2 | /adInMailContents |
+| /audienceCountsV2 | /audienceCounts |
+| /adSegmentsV2 | /adSegments |
+| /adAnalyticsV2 | /adAnalytics |
+| /sharesV2 | /posts |
+| /ugcPosts | /posts |
+| /adAccountsV2 | /adAccounts |
+| /adAccountUsersV2 | /adAccountUsers |
+| /adCampaignGroupsV2 | /adCampaignGroups |
+| /adCampaignsV2 | /adCampaigns |
+| /adCreativesV2 | /creatives |
+| /insightTagDomainsV2 | /insightTagDomains |
+| /adCampaignInsightsV2 | /adCampaignInsights |
+API clients will use HTTP headers to indicate the API version. Releases are titled according to the month in which the development work commenced - again, similar to the way we have pushed releases in the past. Comprehensive documentation and change guides will accompany each release. Our versioned Marketing APIs will be supported and stable for a minimum of one year before sunset.
+Technical Documentation
+LinkedInâs LinkedIn Marketing API Program supports versioning so API partners can release changes over time. This document explains how to use versioned APIs.
+Why are our APIs versioned?
+LinkedIn makes continuous improvements to our products, and thus our APIs must change too. But we want our API partners to have trust in stable integrations with reliable change schedules so that they can plan and execute better over time.
+Thatâs why weâve created a stable supported window of one (1) year (minimum) for our Marketing APIs.
+How your API client should use versioning
+HTTP headers will be used for clients to indicate which API version implementation they expect. Include a request header with the key âLinkedIn-Versionâ and set the value to the version (format: YYYYMM) to correspond with the documentation version youâre referencing, for example - âLinkedIn-Version: 202411â would indicate that you are using the version published in the month of November.
+curl -X POST 'https://api.linkedin.com/rest/adCampaigns' \
+-H 'Authorization: Bearer {INSERT_TOKEN}' \
+-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
+-H 'Linkedin-Version: 202411â \
+--data '{
+"account": "urn:li:sponsoredAccount:123212321",
+"audienceExpansionEnabled": false,
+`}
+...
+Version Headers
+In many cases, the URL resource paths your integration uses may not change across versions, but the behavior of the individual API methods will. For example, there may be new parameters required or new fields available on the response schemas.
+The API changes must include the Version Header for the version (release) that needs to be adopted.
+Example
+For the November 2024 LMS Release, the versioned header would be: "LinkedIn-Version": "202411"
+. Version headers are tied to the LMS Release date:
+| Version | Version Header Values |
+|---|---|
+| November 2024 | "LinkedIn-Version": "202411" |
+| October 2024 | "LinkedIn-Version": "202410" |
+| September 2024 | "LinkedIn-Version": "202409" |
+Versioned API Docs
+Each version of the LinkedIn Marketing API Program has distinct and comprehensive documentation covering all supported APIs. It also includes a changelog indicating all changes from the previous version indicating which resources have been updated or added. Initially, users will have the option on each page in the marketing folder to view: Versioned content: âMarketing {Month} 202Xâ.
+Version Cadence
+LinkedIn Marketing API Program will publish new versions monthly, and those versions will be supported for a minimum of one (1) year.
+Individual API resources may evolve at different times (e.g. a reporting API may be updated one quarter a year). And each API resource will have its own migration guide to help you navigate major updates.
+You could choose to integrate with the newest API changes as soon as theyâre released or wait until youâre ready - as long as itâs within the one year change API support window.
+Expectations
+Keep up with us
+LinkedIn expects that our LinkedIn Marketing API Program API partners work to deliver the latest and most valuable experiences to our customers within a reasonable time of their availability. As a result, we will sunset our API versions as early as one (1) year after release.
+No unversioned calls
+LinkedIn expects every versioned API call to specify a version; we will not default you to the latest version. Itâs important to us that customers have the best possible experience with LinkedIn integrations. And itâs more likely that customers have a great experience when the integration is being regularly maintained (at least once per year).
+Breaking Change Exceptions
+At times, LinkedIn may need to change APIs within the supported stable window.
+LinkedIn reserves the right to release a patch version to any API if required for any critical security or privacy issues or bug fixes. While the likelihood of these scenarios is minimal, we will work closely with partners to minimize the impact of any breaking changes.
+FAQ
+Which versions can I use?
+You can use any version that hasnât been sunset. The documentation will reflect all available API versions. Migrating to the latest version, however, comes with two important benefits:
+- You can take advantage of all of our latest features.
+- You have the option to wait up to a full year before having to migrate again.
+How do I migrate from an older API version to a later version?
+To migrate your app from an older version to a later version, simply update the older versionâs YYYYMM
+formatted value in the header to the later versionâs value. For example, hereâs how youâd migrate from the November 2023 version to the November 2024 version.
+-H âLinkedin-Version: 202311â to -H âLinkedin-Version: 202411â
+Reasons for migrating to a later version include:
+- Avoiding service disruptions; it's important to upgrade to a newer supported version before the older version is no longer supported (weâve committed to supporting each version for a minimum of one year).
+- Utilizing new features that are not accessible in the older version.
+Which version of the API should I migrate to?
+While you can migrate to any later version of the API, migrating to the latest version comes with two important benefits:
+- You can take advantage of all of our latest features.
+- You have the option to wait up to a full year before having to migrate again.
+What happens if the Version Header is missing in the request?
+An error response is returned when the version header is missing in the request. Refer to Sample Response here
+What happens if a deprecated Version Header is used in the request?
+An error response is returned when the version header is deprecated (e.g., 202401). Refer to sample response here</div>

+Meta simplifies Instagram and marketing API integrations
+Meta updates Instagram and Marketing APIs to streamline developer workflows and improve data clarity.
+On January 21, 2025, Meta announced significant updates to the Instagram Graph API and Marketing API, aimed at simplifying integrations for developers and businesses. The changes include the deprecation of several legacy endpoints and the introduction of new fields and metrics to enhance functionality and data clarity. According to the announcement, developers will have until January 21, 2026, to migrate Marketing API endpoints and until April 21, 2025, to update Graph API endpoints.
+The updates focus on replacing older objects such as Instagram User
+, Instagram Media
+, Instagram Carousel
+, and Instagram Comment
+with their newer counterparts: IG User
+, IG Media
+, and IG Comment
+. These changes are designed to provide parity for most use cases while removing redundant or outdated fields. For example, the Instagram Media
+object will no longer support fields like filter_name
+, location
+, latitude
+, and longitude
+. Similarly, the permalink
+and caption
+fields for carousel child media will be removed.
+The IG User
+object introduces new fields such as has_profile_picture
+, is_published
+, and edges like /authorized_adaccounts
+, /agencies
+, and /upcoming_events
+. These additions aim to provide more comprehensive data for developers. The follow_count
+and followed_by_count
+fields have been renamed to follows_count
+and followers_count
+, respectively, while profile_pic
+is now profile_picture_url
+.
+For media objects, the taken_at
+field in Instagram Media
+corresponds to the timestamp
+field in IG Media
+. The content_type
+field, which previously returned an integer, now returns an enum string value (e.g., 0 → IMAGE, 1 → VIDEO, 4 → BROADCAST, 8 → CAROUSEL_ALBUM). The caption_text
+field in Instagram Media
+aligns with the caption
+field in IG Media
+, though carousel child captions will no longer be available. The display_url
+and video_url
+fields have been consolidated into a single media_url
+field, simplifying data retrieval.
+The Instagram Comment
+object has also been updated. The instagram_user
+field now corresponds to the user
+field, which returns an IG User
+instead of an Instagram User
+. Meta has introduced new ID fields, such as ig_user_id
+, ig_media_id
+, and ig_comment_id
+, to facilitate the transition from legacy objects. These fields will remain available until April 21, 2025.
+In the Marketing API, fields like instagram_actor_id
+and instagram_story_id
+will be replaced with instagram_user_id
+and instagram_media_id
+, respectively. Any edge that previously returned an Instagram User
+will now return an IG User
+. According to the announcement, several endpoints will no longer support legacy objects starting January 21, 2026. These include /generatepreviews
+, /act_<adaccount_id>/generatepreviews
+, and various endpoints for ad campaigns, creatives, and async ad requests.
+For the Graph API, legacy objects will no longer be supported after April 21, 2025. Affected endpoints include those for retrieving Instagram user data, media, comments, and carousels, as well as endpoints for managing Instagram accounts linked to Facebook Pages and business assets.
+Meta has also introduced changes to the Insights API to improve metric clarity. In August 2024, Instagram introduced views
+as the primary consumption metric for measuring content performance across reels, live videos, photos, carousels, and stories. Starting with API v22, the views
+metric will be available for both media and user insights. For media insights, Feed, Story, and Reels objects will return views. User insights will support the views
+metric with multi-dimensional breakdowns for follower type and media product type.
+Several older metrics will be deprecated in v22. These include plays
+, clips_replays_count
+, and ig_reels_aggregated_all_plays_count
+for media insights, as well as impressions
+for both media and user insights. The impressions
+metric will only be deprecated for media created on or after July 2, 2024. For older media, the API will continue to return impressions
+values as usual.
+According to the announcement, these updates aim to align the functionality of the Instagram API with the Instagram app, providing businesses and creators with more accurate and actionable data. Developers are encouraged to review the changes and update their applications by the specified deadlines to avoid disruptions.
+The January 21, 2025 announcement reflects Meta’s ongoing efforts to streamline its developer tools and improve data transparency. By consolidating endpoints, introducing new fields, and refining metrics, the company aims to make it easier for developers to build solutions that meet the needs of businesses and creators.
+These updates come at a time when digital platforms are increasingly focused on providing clear and reliable data to users. The shift toward views
+as a primary metric underscores the importance of understanding content performance in a way that aligns with user behavior.
+Meta’s approach to simplifying API integrations and enhancing data clarity demonstrates a commitment to supporting developers and businesses in a rapidly changing digital landscape. The changes announced on January 21, 2025, are expected to have a significant impact on how developers interact with Instagram and Marketing APIs, paving the way for more efficient and effective solutions.
+As the deadlines for migration approach, developers and businesses will need to carefully review the updates and plan their transitions accordingly. The availability of new fields and metrics, along with the deprecation of legacy objects, represents a significant step forward in the evolution of Meta’s developer tools.</div>

+Instagram Metric Deprecation & Views Transition (April 2025)
+Meta (Instagram’s parent company) is making important updates to how performance metrics are delivered via their API. These changes will directly affect metrics like Impressions and Plays. Please read below to learn more. To stay ahead of this update and ensure a smooth transition for our customers, Zoomph is updating its platform to support Meta’s new Views metric and remove deprecated metrics.
+What’s Changing in the Instagram API?
+Meta will deprecate the following metrics for all versions of the Instagram API on April 21, 2025. Zoomph will implement supporting changes on April 17, 2025.
+- Impressions
+- Plays (on Reels, this includes Replays on Reels as well)
+Instagram's API is introducing a new metric, "Views" to replace both "Impressions and "Plays".
+-
+Views is defined as any time a Reel plays (or is replayed) on a screen, or when a feed post, carousel, or story is displayed on screen (including repeat views). Meta introduced this new metric to provide a consistent, unified standard across all content types.
+- For Reels, a View is count if the reel plays for 0.1 seconds on screen.
+- Views will include every instance content is displayed - even if the same user views it multiple times.
+-
+This change may result in higher reported numbers for non-video formats compared to Impressions
+-
+Based on our research, Views are, on average, 25% higher than Impressions.
+🔗 View Meta’s official changelog
+✅ What Zoomph Is Updating
+To ensure reporting continues smoothly and remains aligned with Meta’s standards, Zoomph will make the following changes:
+📅 Effective April 17, 2025
+On Authenticated/Owned Instagram Content:
+-
+The new Views metric will appear for all Instagram posts (Feed Posts, Reels, Stories, and Carousels) created after April 17, 2025.
+-
+The Social Value metric will now use Views against Instagram CPM for all content created after that date.
+-
+Logo Impressions on Instagram content will be based on Views.
+-
+Video Views, previously deprecated, will no longer appear. Views is now the primary video performance metric.
+On Unauthenticated/Earned/Non-Owned Instagram Content
+- Projected Impressions will be renamed to “Projected Views”.
+- Logo Impressions will now be based on "Projected Views".
+-
+The Social Value metric will use Projected Views against Instagram CPM for all content created after April 17, 2025.
+Across All Instagram Content:
+Reporting Dashboards:
+Zoomph will display “Views/Impressions” when aggregating metrics across multiple platforms (e.g., X/Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) in:
+- Social Overview Reports
+- Custom Social Reports
+- Brand Reports
+For example, if you have a feed that aggregates X(Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram post data, all reporting dashboards will aggregated "Views" from Instagram and "Impressions" from the other platforms together under a "Views/Impressions" label.
+Post Export
+- The export will now display “PostViewsImpressions” (replacing “PostImpressions”)
+-
+This column will reflect Views for Instagram and Impressions for other platforms.
+Zoomph API and Brand Export:
+- Zoomph’s API and Brand Exposure Export will continue to use the column header “Impressions” to avoid disruption to existing integrations.
+- Instagram Views will be passed into the existing “Impressions” column.
+- No new columns will be introduced at this time.
+- The Impressions metric will no longer be available for Instagram content on Zoomph’s platform or API starting April 17, 2025.
+- Historical Impressions data will remain available for content created before this date.
+- Posts created prior to April 17 will continue to use Impressions to calculate metrics such as Social Value, Engagement, and Logo Impressions.
+Frequently Asked Questions
+Q: Will historical Impressions be deleted?
+A: No. Impressions data for content created before April 17, 2025 will remain available in Zoomph.
+Q: Will this impact my brand value and brand impressions reporting?
+A: Yes — beginning April 17, Views will become the basis for brand value calculations in place of Impressions.
+Q: If I use the API, do I need to update my API integrations?
+A: No.

+- How to Get Ahead of the Instagram Algorithm
+What Is the Instagram Algorithm?
+The Instagram algorithm is a system used by the social media platform to determine the order in which content is displayed in a user's feed.
+You’ll often hear the Instagram algorithm referred to as a singular concept, but there are really multiple algorithms at play.
+In fact, Instagram describes it as a "variety of algorithms, classifiers, and processes, each with its own purpose. We want to make the most of people’s time, and we believe that using technology to personalize everyone’s experience is the best way to do that."
+In other words, Instagram's algorithms have one goal: to make you stay on the app longer by delivering content you'll find relevant and interesting.
+The algorithm majorly affects how social media managers work.
+“Instagram’s algorithms impact the day-to-day life of just about social media professional in big ways,” says Later’s Social Team.
+“In order to create best-in-class content that drives growth and engagement, we’re required to produce a wide range of assets—from videos to statics, carousels, stories, to lives, and more—multiple times a day, every day.”
+However, you can use it to your advantage.
+By tailoring your strategy to "hack" what Instagram's algorithm is prioritizing — so you can reach more users and build a community of engaged followers.
+How Does the Instagram Algorithm Work in 2025?
+There are multiple factors that Instagram will use to evaluate its algorithm in 2025, depending on what you’re posting.
+According to a deep dive into ranking from Instagram itself, each algorithm uses different “signals” to determine what will rank on your feed.
+The major takeaway? Each Instagram algorithm ranks content based on different signals:
+The Instagram Feed algorithm: Your activity in-feed (likes, comments, shares, and saves), and info about the post and the person who posted.
+The Instagram Stories algorithm: Stories you've viewed or engaged with in the past.
+The Instagram Explore Page algorithm: Your activity in Explore (likes, comments, and shares), and info about the post and the person who posted.
+The Instagram Reels algorithm: Your activity in Reels (likes, comments, shares, and saves), and info about the Reel and the person who posted.
+Here’s what all of these signals have in common: The algorithm will reward content that resonates with your audience.
+Read on for an in-depth breakdown of how each algorithm works.
+How the Instagram Algorithm Works for Feed Posts
+Remember the days when your Instagram was a chronological story of what your friends were eating for lunch that day?
+Now, things are a little more complex.
+The feed now consists of Reels and posts from followed accounts as well as suggested content.
+The signals the Instagram algorithm uses to evaluate feed posts are:
+Your activity: Users see content from topics and accounts that they're already liking, saving, or sending.
+Information about the post: If a feed post is going viral or has a high engagement rate, Instagram is more likely to include it in the feed.
+Information about the poster: People get recommended posts from users who are similar to the ones they already follow and interact with.
+Your history of interacting with someone: If you’re always liking someone’s posts or frequently visiting their profile, the algorithm will consider this.
+The moral of the story is the higher the engagement your posts have, the better.
+TIP: Use Later's Instagram Analytics to understand which posts deliver the highest engagement for your account and optimize your strategy.
+How the Instagram Reels Algorithm Works
+Knowing how to "hack" the Reels algorithm can be a huge advantage for anyone looking to grow on Instagram.
+Much like feed posts, Instagram prioritizes Reels based on what it believes a viewer will be most likely to interact with.
+The signals it uses to determine Reels ranking are very similar to feed posts:
+Your activity
+Information about the reel
+Information about the poster
+Your history of interacting with someone
+According to Instagram, brands and creators should create Reels that are entertaining, inspiring, or experimental and use creative tools like text, camera effects, or filters.
+Psst, bookmark this blog for additional Reels tips: The Ultimate Guide to Instagram Reels.
+How the Instagram Story Algorithm Works
+The Instagram story algorithm works a little differently, as you don’t see accounts you haven’t followed in your Story feed (yet).
+However, the key ranking signals for the Instagram Story algorithm are similar:
+Viewing history: The algorithm will start by showing people the stories they know they’ll enjoy (so they’ll stay on the app longer, of course).
+Engagement history: People are served stories from accounts that they’ve previously DMed or reacted to.
+Closeness: The algorithm evaluates how likely it is that an account comes from a close friend or family member. That’s why you’ll often see Close Friends’ stories show up at the beginning of the Story feed.
+ICYMI: With Later, you can plan and automatically publish your Instagram Stories, add captions or links, and set a publish time.
+Start scheduling your Instagram Stories in advance with Later with a free trial of any plan.
+How the Instagram Explore Page Algorithm Works
+The Instagram Explore page algorithm delivers content that it thinks you’ll be most interested in, based on your prior interactions.
+While your Instagram Home feed is mostly made up of content from accounts you already follow, the Explore feed consists entirely of content from new accounts.
+The signals the algorithm uses to rank Explore posts include:
+Information about the post: How popular a post seems to be — like how quickly users are interacting with it. These signals matter much more here than they do for Feed and Stories.
+Activity in Explore: How you've interacted with posts in the past.
+Information about the person who posted: How many times people have interacted with them in the past few weeks.
+The Explore page is constantly evolving, with new topic categories and advanced search functionalities being introduced all the time.
+So, by continually sharing engaging content with strong captions, relevant keywords, and niche hashtags, you’re optimizing your posts for Explore page potential.
+TIP: Write your Instagram captions in advance with Later's Instagram Scheduler.
+How to Reset the Instagram Algorithm
+Short answer: You can't "reset" the Instagram algorithm.
+If your account isn’t appearing on any feeds, you may have been “shadowbanned”. Read this post to learn what shadowbanning is - and how to undo it.
+However, there are a couple of ways you can refresh the content shown in your feed:
+By clearing your search history
+By tapping "Not Interested" on suggested posts
+The good news? If you haven't been shadowbanned, there's plenty you can do to boost the chances of others seeing your content (keep reading).
+7 Tips to Beat the Instagram Algorithm in 2025
+If you want to improve your ranking with the Instagram algorithm, the best thing you can do is drive as many interactions (likes, comments, saves, and clicks) as possible.
+And by building momentum with your existing community, you’ll soon find your content surfaced to new audiences.
+Here are seven ways to improve your algorithmic ranking and reach new audiences:
+Tip #1: Use Instagram SEO
+Optimizing your Instagram for search - whether that be through the Explore page or through the search bar - is one of the best ways to keep your account discoverable.
+And when it’s easy to find your content, you’ll be encouraging those interactions that the algorithm sees as strong signals.
+From using keywords in your captions and profiles to adding subtitles to Instagram Reels, Instagram SEO is an essential social media tool.
+Tip #2: Encourage More Interactions with Instagram Stories Stickers
+Instagram Stories stickers are a great way to encourage audience engagement — and the more engagement your posts get, the higher they’ll be boosted by the Instagram algorithm.
+There are lots of Instagram stickers, but the best ones for driving engagement are the poll, emoji slider, and question stickers.
+TIP: Include a sticker on your first story for an added boost!
+Tip #3: Drive Conversations with Engaging Captions
+Instagram has confirmed comments and likes are important when it comes to feed ranking — so it’s a good idea to encourage as many as possible for your posts.
+One of the best ways to do this? Write strong captions that drive engagement.
+This could be as simple as asking your followers to share their thoughts, double-tap if they agree, tag a friend in the comments, or click the link in your bio.
+With Later's AI Caption Writer, you can create on-brand captions in seconds — no brainstorming required.
+Tip #4: Add Relevant Hashtags to Your Posts
+Adding hashtags to your posts is an effective way to reach more people on Instagram, which means more “views” for the Instagram algorithm to take into account.
+It’s important to focus on quality, hyper-relevant hashtags — even using 5 or 10 hashtags is better than zero.
+Use Later's Hashtag Suggestions tool to automatically find relevant hashtags for your posts based on your caption and other hashtags you search. Work smarter, not harder.
+Tip #5: Optimize for Views
+Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced in the summer of 2024 that Instagram’s analytics would be views-focused and that users should optimize for Views instead of likes and engagement.
+This update indicates that you should evaluate your content’s success on how visible it is.
+While we don’t have this confirmed, this also suggests that Views might be seen by Instagram’s algorithm as a strong ranking signal.
+Some ways you can optimize for Views include:
+Creating trends-focused content
+Collaborating with other creators
+Engage with your audience
+Post at your personalized Best Time to Post
+Tip #6: Cross-promote Your Instagram Content
+If you’re looking for a quick and easy engagement win to help boost your algorithm ranking, cross-promoting your Instagram content is a great place to start.
+Instagram Collabs posts (with co-shared authorship) are an incredible new way to reach new audiences.
+You’ll share views, likes, and comments — allowing you to leverage and engage with each other’s communities.
+Tip #7: Use Instagram Analytics to See What’s Working
+Tracking and monitoring analytics is one of the most reliable ways to take on the Instagram algorithm.
+Having a better understanding of what’s working (and what isn’t) will help you come up with a finely-tuned marketing plan, saving you time and effort in the long run.
+But diving into your Instagram Analytics means more than just finding out which photo, video, or Reel performed best.
+Truly understanding how your content performs — by tracking key metrics over time — is vital to knowing what helps improve your ranking.
+The easiest way to do this? Later’s Analytics feature:
+The tool lets you track up to 12 months' worth of Instagram feed posts, Stories, and Reels so you can see exactly what's performed best — and filter by key metrics like engagement, followers, reach, likes, and more.
+Plus, you can export your Instagram analytics directly to your desktop (in a CSV file) making it easy to keep all of your numbers in spreadsheet format.
+How to Get Ahead of the Instagram Algorithm
+The best way to gain an advantage with the Instagram algorithm in 2025?
+Know your niche, create engaging content, and be consistent. The Instagram algorithm will do the rest.
+TIP: Plan your Instagram content in advance so you can have an organized content calendar (and save time!). Start a free trial with Later today.</div>
